**University Project | Econometrics Class | December 2025**

## Overview
This repository contains **Case Study 3**, a statistical analysis investigating labor mobility in Austria (1986–1998). The aim was to model how often workers change employers based on socioeconomic factors like age, gender, and income.

## The Analysis
Written in **LaTeX** with **R** integration, the project covers:
* **Regression Modeling:** OLS, quadratic terms, and interaction effects.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** F-tests for coefficient equality.
* **Model Selection:** Comparing models using AIC and BIC.
* **Diagnostics:** Testing OLS assumptions.

## Tools
* **Languages:** R, LaTeX
* **Libraries:** `tidyverse`, `car`, `AICcmodavg`
* **Data:** `change.csv` (Labor market count data)
